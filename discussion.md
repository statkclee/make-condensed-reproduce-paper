title: Automating Tasks with Make
subtitle: Discussion

*   There are many other tools for managing dependencies that owe less to Make.
    Perhaps the most interesting is [SCons](http://www.scons.org),
    which grew out of the original Software Carpentry design
    competition in the late 1990s.

*   GNU Make comes with a comprehensive
    [manual](https://www.gnu.org/s/make/manual/).  The
    [Quick Reference](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Quick-Reference.html)
    chapter is particularly useful, because it provides a condensed
    list of all the cryptic variables like `$<`, `$@`, `$+`, etc.
    (When running on Linux, the manual can be accessed with `info
    make`.)

*   Large projects may have separate Makefiles in every directory.  This
    is fine, but you should avoid having Make call Make for reasons
    described in
    [Recursive Make Considered Harmful](http://aegis.sourceforge.net/auug97.pdf).

*   Makefiles are often generated by other programs instead of being
    written by hand.  This is done to deal with portability issues and
    solve the problem of configuration.  Two examples
    [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) and
    [Automake](http://www.gnu.org/s/automake/); the first is a bit
    easier to use, the second one more popular and powerful.
